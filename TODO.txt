-The Rented Cars table is ambiguous. Is the ID the car ID or the rental ID? I think the table needs both.
-This is important for finding the rental when the user clicks return selected.
-The car contains no reference to the rental, so just having the car is useless.
-OR, make sure cars get references to their rentals. not a big fan though.
